## 🧠 Project Overview
This project investigates the security vulnerabilities of widely-used cryptographic protocols—**TLS**, **IPsec**, and **DNSSEC**—in the context of **quantum computing**. The analysis utilizes two well-established threat modeling frameworks: **STRIDE** and **PASTA**, to identify, simulate, and assess quantum-specific threats.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify and compare vulnerabilities in TLS, IPsec, and DNSSEC under quantum threat models.
- Apply STRIDE and PASTA frameworks for structured threat analysis.
- Propose mitigation strategies using quantum-resistant cryptographic solutions.

## 🛠️ Methodology
- **STRIDE Model** was used to categorize threats like Spoofing, Tampering, etc.
- **PASTA Framework** simulated realistic quantum-enabled attack scenarios across a 7-stage process.
- Comparative study was conducted across protocols and models to evaluate risk and resilience.

## 🧪 Key Features
- Threat modeling of TLS, IPsec, and DNSSEC.
- Attack simulation and analysis under potential quantum threats.
- Recommendations for post-quantum cryptographic adaptations.

## 📌 Key Takeaways
- Public-key cryptographic components in current protocols are critically vulnerable to quantum attacks.
- STRIDE provides a structured threat breakdown; PASTA enables deep simulation and risk analysis.
- Urgent need to transition to quantum-resistant algorithms such as lattice-based cryptography.
